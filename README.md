# Core-Malware-Scanner

A simple Python script to scan a directory for malware by calculating the SHA-256 hash of each file and checking it against the VirusTotal database.

## Features
- Calculate the SHA-256 hash of files in a specified directory.
- Check the SHA-256 hash against VirusTotal's database to identify malware.
- Generate a report of infected files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `colorama` library
- `tkinter` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/suraj944/Core-Malware-Scanner.git  
    cd malware-scanner
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install requests colorama
    ```
## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python malware_scanner.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the directory you want to scan.

3. The script will calculate the SHA-256 hash of each file in the selected directory and check it against VirusTotal's database.

4. If any malware is found, it will be listed in the terminal and saved to `Malware_Report.txt`.

## API Key

The script uses the VirusTotal API to check file hashes. You need to have a VirusTotal API key. Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your own:
```python
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
